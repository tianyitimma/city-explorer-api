Custom Servers with Node and Express
Overview
In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.

Process
For every lab in this module, you will have a new partner. You and your new partner(s) will spend the first 30 minutes reviewing each other's code from the previous lab and planning out an approach to this lab's work on a whiteboard.

Do a formal code review of each person's code (10 minutes each).
Open your partner's GitHub pull request on your laptop.
Identify an area in the code that:
you don't understand
or seams overly complex
or you see a way to improve
or you want more information on
or you really like or think is interesting
Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.
Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 10 minutes).
Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
Outline the functions that support this data flow.
Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.
You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

Workflow
We will be using the Trello{:target="_blank"} project management tool for the duration of this project.
To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the Sign Up button.
After creating an account, go to the City Explorer Trello Board{:target="_blank"}, open the "... Show Menu" link, click the "... More" link, and then click "Copy Board". Before you create it, be sure to "Change" from Private to "Public" (and click "Yes, Make Board Public") so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click "Create" to add a copy to your personal account.
This Trello board contains all of the features required to complete this lab assignment.
In the "...Show Menu" sidebar, click the "Search Cards" link and filter by lab to see the assignment for just the current day.
Review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.
Within each story, note the acceptance criteria ("Given ... When ... Then...") and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.
Throughout the lab time, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.
Documentation
You must have a complete README.md for both your server and your website repositories.

Your README.md must include:

# Project Name

**Author**: Your Name Goes Here
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Time Estimates
For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

Name of feature: 

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____
Add this information to your README.

Submission Instructions
Complete your Feature Tasks for the lab, according to the Trello cards.
Create a PR back to the main branch of your repository, showing ALL your work, and merge it cleanly.
On Canvas, submit a link to your PR. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
A link to the deployed version of your latest code.
A link to your public Trello board.
A question within the context of today's lab assignment.
An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment.
How long you spent working on this assignment.
